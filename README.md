# Power-Bi-Project

A Power BI project on "Cats vs Dog Population in the US" involves analyzing data on the number of cats and dogs in different states and creating visualizations to compare their populations.

Power BI provides a range of visualization tools that can be used to create interactive dashboards. The dashboard can include visualizations such as maps, bar charts, and pie charts to compare the cat and dog populations in different states.

This project on Cats vs Dog Population in the US can provide valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of cat and dog populations and help inform policy decisions and animal welfare initiatives.
